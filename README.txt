I am aiming to produce the a Neural Network from scratch without any special functions from pandas/scikit/keras etc.
Comparitive model   -   https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html

Goals:
  - I am hoping to match my model within a few percentage to comparitive model.
  - Compare to other MLMs for my premier league predicitons project.
